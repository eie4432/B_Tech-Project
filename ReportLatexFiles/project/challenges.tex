\chapter{Open Research Challenges}

In order to compare the performance of ML models and algorithms, it is crucial to have common benchmarks and open datasets. While this is the rule in the computer vision,voice recognition, and natural language processing domains (e.g., MNIST10 or ImageNet11), nothing comparable exists for communications. This domain is somewhat different because it deals with inherently man made signals that can be accurately generated synthetically, allowing the possibility of standardizing data generation routines rather than just data in some cases. It would be also desirable to establish a set of common problems and the corresponding datasets (or data-generating software) on which researchers can benchmark and compare their algorithms. One such example task is modulation classification ; others could include mapping of impaired received IQ samples or symbols to codewords or bits.
